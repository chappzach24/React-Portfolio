            Hey, I'm Zachary Chapmanâ€”a programmer, gamer, and new parent. By
              day, I code solutions; by night, I conquer virtual worlds.
              Parenthood recently joined the adventure, adding chaos and joy.
              Join me as I share insights, experiences, and the delightful
              intersection of code, games, and parenting. Let's connect and
              explore together!
          </p>
