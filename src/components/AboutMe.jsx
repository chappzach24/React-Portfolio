            Hey, I'm <span className="name">Zachary Chapman</span>â€”a passionate web developer. I love turning ideas into reality through code and constantly expanding my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

            By day, I craft elegant solutions to complex problems; by night, I immerse myself in virtual adventures, conquering challenges and discovering new horizons. Parenthood recently joined the adventure, adding an extra dose of chaos and joy to my journey.
